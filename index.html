  <h2>A little about me.</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      I have done many jobs in my career. Dishwasher, server, machinist, and restoration tech. Working in the restaurant business you learn to work in high stress and high demand situations. Working as a machinist is were i got my first taste for programming. It was for righting programs for cnc lathes and mills. It gave me an eye for detail. When you consider I was working with tolerances of .0001 of an inch.

      Working in the restoration business taught me how to help people in some of there worst times. I was able to help people get back to there lives after a fire or flood. I was able to get 5 certifications. Learned how to lead a team. I was able to learn how to work with people in high stress situations. Being a Dad is probably the most important job I have ever had. I have learned how to be patient and understanding. I have learned how to be a friend and a father. I have learned how well kids can humble you (make things better in your own life).
