            <!--<p>I have learned many things in my life I started as a dishwasher. Worked my way up to a server. When I left that job I became a machinist. Worked doing programming. I set up cnc lathes and mills. After that I worked for a Restoration company were I did fire and water restoration. From that job I got 3 certifications. Learning is how I was able to do the vastly different jobs.</p>-->
